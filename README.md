## Description
The general transportation problem is concerned with determining an optimal strategy for distributing a commodity from a group of supply centers, such as factories, called sources, to various receiving centers, such as warehouses, called destinations, in such a way as to minimize total distribution costs.

Each source is able to supply a fixed number of units of the product, usually called the capacity or availability, and each destination has a fixed demand, often called the requirement.

Transportation models can also be used when a firm is trying to decide where to locate a new facility. Good financial decisions concerning facility location also attempt to minimize total transportation and production costs for the entire system.

## Task
There are 4 warehouse containing some number of units of the same type of product (see table 1), there is also 5 consumers depend on a certain amount of these products (see table 2). When shipping one unit from warehouse i to consumer j costs Pij arise. The magnitude of the costs is shown in table 3.

For the transportation K units from warehouse i to consumer j the total transportation cost is K*Pij.

The task is to find a transportation plan in which the total transportation cost of all products to all consumers will be minimal.
